# Power-BI-Interactive-dasboards-and-analysis-of-online-retail-store

â€¢	I analyzed online retail store large datasets, performed ETL in Python and data modelling, data cleaning, transformation and dashboarding in Power BI, and built insights dashboards as a Power BI Developer to increase business expansion opportunities and improve overall performance and revenue growth. This experience has given me the ability to work with large datasets, extract meaningful insights and build dashboards using Power BI that drive business growth.
